Arduino Build
=============

Todo: update with the makefile at <http://ed.am/dev/make/arduino-mk>

To build Arduino using MakeTool while still using the Arduino libraries etc. 

[Docs](http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html)

Prerequisites
-------------

* The AVR tool chain. See AvrBuild.
* Perl YAML module (to parse boards.txt).
* The [Ardunio environment](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
* The [Makefile](https://github.com/mjoldfield/Arduino-Makefile).

Libraries
---------

Put extra libs in /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries.

I have added the libraries I use (MsTimer2, ProtoThreads, HCSR04Ultrasonic and SerialLCD) to a GitVersionControl [repository](https://github.com/daijo/~ArduinoLibraries) that I can sync with the Arduino enviromment. Hopefully this will be redundant in the future with a more centralized and automated approach to libraries in the Arduino world.
