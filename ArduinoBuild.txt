Arduino Build
=============

The Arduino enviroment consist of a few different parts:

* 1) The Arduino IDE
* 2) The Arduino libraries
* 3) The Arduino bootloader

It uses the same tool chain as described in AvrBuild. Focus here will mostly be on part 2) and 3).\
The IDE can be replace with your favorite editor and a Makefile.

Arduino on ~ATtiny
-----------------

Officially Arduino only supports ~ATmega devices but it is possible to run on ~ATtiny.\
It might be a good idea to prototype on a full Arduino board and later move to a small\
custom board with a ~ATtiny if the number of required I/O pins permit.

One port is the [arduino-tiny](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/) project. \
Download and put in your Arduino environments hardware directory (like Arduino/hardware/tiny/). I had to rebuild my IDE \
to make it show up in the Tools -> Board menu. If you use a Arduino Makefile it will most likely need to be modified.

Arduino Makefile
----------------

A pre-written drop-in makefile can be found at <http://ed.am/dev/make/arduino-mk>. It allows you to build Arduino \
using MakeTool while still using the Arduino libraries etc. 

It needs to be modified for arduino-tiny support (TBD).

### Prerequisites

* The [Ardunio environment](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
* The [Makefile](https://github.com/mjoldfield/Arduino-Makefile).

An alternative is <https://github.com/mjoldfield/Arduino-Makefile> described at <http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html>.

Libraries
---------

Put extra libs in /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries.

I have added the libraries I use (MsTimer2, ProtoThreads, HCSR04Ultrasonic and SerialLCD) to a GitVersionControl \
[repository](https://github.com/daijo/~ArduinoLibraries) that I can sync with the Arduino enviromment. Hopefully this \
will be redundant in the future with a more centralized and automated approach to libraries in the Arduino world.
