~PotBliki
=========

Plain text [Bliki][1] tools inspired by Edwin Steiner's [PotWiki][2] for Vim, Matt Web's [TextMate bundle][3] and the Git-powered plain text blog [Toto][4].

The project goal is to provide a small set of simple tools for publishing a personal Bliki.

Uses [Sundown][5]. [Source][6] available on Github.

## Run tests

    chmod u+x runtests
    ./runtests

## Start using

1. Install lib/sundown (install where you will put potbliki).
2. Install the script in your PATH using 'install [PATH]'.
3. In the directory you want to be your Bliki home run 'potwiki init'.
4. Edit .bliki/bliki_conf
5. Write wikipages and posts in Markdown.
6. Run 'potwiki make'.

It is recommended to use a plain text wiki plugin for your editor.

## Vim plugin

Make the bliki:

    <Leader>bm

## Post header

Every blog post should have the following header:

    title: [TITLE]
    author: [LASTNAME] [FIRSTNAME]
    date: [YYYY]/[MM]/[DD]
    location: [CITY], [COUNTRY]
    tags: [TAGS]

## Escape ~WikiWords
Warning: this section will not be correct if vieved in plain text but will look correct in the Bliki.

Sometimes you want to escape the ~WikiWords. Use ~~ in front of the WikiWord and it won't be made in to a link. If you want to use a ~~ write ~~~ and one will survive the process.

    ~~WikiWord

is rendered like

~WikiWord;

while

    ~WikiWord

is rendered like

WikiWord.

## Github Integration

### Edit pages on Github

If you store the Bliki repository on Github you can fill in the following info in .bliki/bliki_conf:

    GITHUB_REPO_URL="https://github.com/daijo/Bliki"

This will make a "Edit on Github" link appear on each page. If you have access to the repo there you can edit the page following the link.

### Update Bliki on Github post-receive

Install the script on the server according to 'Start using' and pull the bliki git from Github.

Make sure the TARGET_DIR in bliki_conf point to the web server root. In the bliki directory run:

    potbliki github
    potbliki make

Set Githubs post-receive post to:

    [Your bliki's URL]/cgi-bin/push.cgi

Anytime you push to your repo on Github the bliki will now pull from the repo and remake the bliki.

## Disqus Integration

If you have a Disqus-account, register the Bliki there and enter the Disqus short name in your .bliki_conf:

    DISQUS_SHORTNAME="techaregbliki"
