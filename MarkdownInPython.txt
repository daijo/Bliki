Found a nice Markdown parser in Python [link][1]. Checking out the [Github][2] page I found a lot of neat stuff I can use in additon to the parser. A markdown plugin for VimEditor and a GitVCS hook that parse MarkDown files after they have been pushed to a repo. I only need to write a PythonLanguage script that parse all text files and turn all CamelCase words in to Markdown links to html/CamelCase.html. I'm also leaning towards using the [Mongoose][3]. 

Ok let me just try a nice feature. Easy link back to an old article like FirstPost.
