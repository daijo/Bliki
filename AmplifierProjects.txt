Amplifier Projects
===================

Elekit PS-3239
--------------

A small amp kit using the TEA2025B chip. Looks pretty much like the design in the datasheet.

The screw terminals wasn't included in the kit but it felt like a good idea adding them. Lesson learned from my CMoy that is basically soldered into its Altoid box never to be moved. Nice with some extra flexibility.

Put together as a small and cheap and battery operable stereo system. I got a pair of Fostex full range speakers to use for this purpose. These are good quality drivers so should be able to keep them if I build better amps in the future.

BOM:

* 1 x Elekit PS-3239 stereo amplifier kit (2 x 2.4W into 8 ohm) 1340 JPY
* 1 x 12V/2A wall wart 1200 JPY
* 2 x Fostex P800-E speaker cabinets 2800 JPY / pair
* 2 x Fostex FF85WK full fange drivers 5600 JPY / pair
* Some connectors and a volume knob ~<1000 JPY
* 1 Altoid tin bought in Cambodia $2 incl. mints

Total: ~12000 JPY (mainly for the speakers)

Worked well. Unless you're throwing a party or is in a big room it's powerful enough with these speakers. Audio quality it seem to sound best at about 1/3 of max volume with a 9V battery. Data below on the TEA2025B chip supports that.

With the screw terminals on the board the final assembly was a breeze.

### Power supply

The 12V wall wart I got didnt work well. I'm not sure about it's specs. I verified it's isolated but might be unregulated and maybe a switcher. Anyway it makes the amp hum. Will try and make some measurements on it later.

Result was a lot better with a single 9V battery.

### TEA2025B

From data sheet:

> The TEA2025B/D is a monolithic integrated circuit intended for use as dual or bridge power audio amplifier portable radio cassette players.

So not exactly a Hi-Fi amp perhaps.

The power output is a function of speaker impedans and input voltage. In 8 ohm 9V give a maximum of ~1.4W and 12V give 2.4W.

In 8 ohm the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) take a big jump above 0.4W in output power.

Stepped Attenuator
-------------------

A stepped stereo attenuator in a separate enclosure. So you don't have to put a high quality volume control pot in every single amplifier build.

BOM:

* 1 x Stepped attenuator 1000 JPY
* 4 x RCA sockets 500 JPY
* 1 x Volume knob ??? JPY
* 1 x Small project enclosure ??? JPY

T-Class 2x15W
-------------

Decided I needed a small amplifier on my desk/workbench for listening to music while working, testing DACs and speaker builds. The amplifier chip used is the Tripath TA2024.

The enclosure is a bit on the big side but it's nice not to be cramped and I expect to reuse the enclosure for other modules when this one gets dated.

BOM:

* 2 x RCA sockets 250 JPY
* 4 x Speaker connectors 400 JPY
* 1 x Small project enclosure 1200 JPY


LM1875 based 2x25W Chip-Amp
---------------------------

Moving on through the DIY audio standards. Next up a "Chip-Amp" using two K50 PCB kits. A Chip-Amp is a amplifier on a chip that only requires a few additional components to filter the supply voltage, set gain and provide feedback. I basically works as an power op-amp.

Things to remember is to have big enough heatsinks and that the chip mount carries the negative powerrail so it needs to be insulated from the heatsink/chassi.

### Powersupply

The amps need a dual power supply (+/- 25V). For this build I'm using a unregulated PSU board from the same source as the amp boards (K114).

80VA 2x18V.

IEC connector with switch and fuse holder. Grounded chassi.

First Watt F4
-------------

The F4 is a special amplifier in the sense that its voltage gain is 1. In other words it's a current source amplifer and will produce the same voltage swing on the output as on the input but with enough current as needed to maintain that voltage over the load (within reason). Because of this it will need a preamp with enough voltage gain to produce a voltage that will drive the speakers.

It's also special in the sense that all power MOSFETS are arranged in a 'source-follower' configuration which adds very little to the sound passing through the amp.

The output into 8ohm is 2 x 25W at 20 V P-P.
