Amplifier Projects
===================

Elekit PS-3239
--------------

A small amp kit using the TEA2025B chip. Looks pretty much like the design in the datasheet.

The screw terminals wasn't included in the kit but it felt like a good idea adding them. Lesson learned from my CMoy that is basically soldered into its Altoid box never to be moved. Nice with some extra flexibility.

Put together as a small and cheap and battery operable stereo system. I got a pair of Fostex full range speakers to use for this purpose. These are good quality drivers so should be able to keep them if I build better amps in the future.

BOM:

* 1 x Elekit PS-3239 stereo amplifier kit (2 x 2.4W into 8 ohm) 1340 JPY
* 1 x 12V/2A wall wart 1200 JPY
* 2 x Fostex P800-E speaker cabinets 2800 JPY / pair
* 2 x Fostex FF85WK full fange drivers 5600 JPY / pair
* Some connectors and a volume knob ~<1000 JPY
* 1 Altoid tin bought in Cambodia $2 incl. mints

Total: ~12000 JPY (mainly for the speakers)

Worked well. Unless you're throwing a party or is in a big room it's powerful enough with these speakers. Audio quality it seem to sound best at about 1/3 of max volume with a 9V battery. Data below on the TEA2025B chip supports that.

With the screw terminals on the board the final assembly was a breeze.

### Power supply

The 12V wall wart I got didnt work well. I'm not sure about it's specs. I verified it's isolated but might be unregulated and maybe a switcher. Anyway it makes the amp hum. Will try and make some measurements on it later.

Result was a lot better with a single 9V battery.

### TEA2025B

From data sheet:

> The TEA2025B/D is a monolithic integrated circuit intended for use as dual or bridge power audio amplifier portable radio cassette players.

So not exactly a Hi-Fi amp perhaps.

The power output is a function of speaker impedans and input voltage. In 8 ohm 9V give a maximum of ~1.4W and 12V give 2.4W.

In 8 ohm the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) take a big jump above 0.4W in output power.

Stepped Attenuator
-------------------

A stepped stereo attenuator in a separate enclosure. So you don't have to put a high quality volume control pot in every single amplifier build.

BOM:

* 1 x Stepped attenuator 1000 JPY
* 4 x RCA sockets 500 JPY
* 1 x Volume knob ??? JPY
* 1 x Small project enclosure ??? JPY

T-Class 2x15W with balanced/unbalanced input
--------------------------------------------

For desk/workbench and initial testing of balanced DAC and speaker builds.

LM1875 based 25W mono blocks with balanced input
------------------------------------------------

For the livingroom. Using two K50 PCB kits.

### Powersupply

The amps need a dual power supply (+/- 25V).

2x 60VA 35V center tapped secondary.

IEC connector with switch and fuse holder. Grounded chassi.

Balanced tube preamp/buffer amplifier
