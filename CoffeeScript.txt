~CoffeeScript
=============

> "CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. The language adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell[1] to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability, as well as adding more sophisticated features like array comprehension and pattern matching. CoffeeScript compiles predictably to JavaScript and programs can be written with less code (typically 1/3 fewer lines) with no effect on runtime performance.[2] Since March 16, 2011, CoffeeScript has been on GitHub's list of most-watched projects.[3]" - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript>
