General info [here][1], [here][2] and [here][3].

### Data Interface

To connect to a computer the TS-680 needs the IF-10C module installed and IF-232C interface and level converter. They are out of production like the tranceiver itself and hard to find. The latter also is a bit old fashioned nowadays when USB is the norm.

The interface cable can be [made][4] with a USB chip like the FT232RL. The connections from FT232RL to the 6-pin DIN is:

    GND - Pin 1
    RXD - Pin 2
    TXD - Pin 3
    RTS - Pin 4
    CTS - Pin 5

The [IF-10C][5] module connects the internal logic to the 6-pin DIN socket.

Commercial IF-10C [substitute][6] that also replaces the level converter.
