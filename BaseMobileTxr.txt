Base/Mobile Tranceivers
=======================

Kenwood TS-680S
---------------

HF/6m tranceiver that run on 12-16V using just above 1.5A for RX and 20A for full power TX.

General info [here][1], [here][2] and [here][3].

### Remote Interface

This is a 7-pin DIN plug used to connect to an external linear amplifier or transverter. It has an ALC input and a T/R-relay connection. The ALC input is biased down to -10V for minimum power output.

### Serial Interface

To connect to a computer the TS-680 needs the IF-10C module installed and IF-232C interface and level converter. They are out of production like the transceiver itself and hard to find. The latter also is a bit old fashioned nowadays when USB is the norm.

The interface cable can be [made][4] with a USB chip like the FT232RL. The connections from FT232RL to the 6-pin DIN is:

          6-pin DIN  (ACC1)
    GND - Pin 1
    RXD - Pin 2
    TXD - Pin 3
    RTS - Pin 4
    CTS - Pin 5

    Serial interface full  duplex
    Transfer rate:     4800 BPS
    Sync:              Asynchronous
    Bit construction:  1 start bit, 8 character bits, 2 stop bits  (NO parity)

Even easier it can be made by soldering a 6-pin DIN plug to a cheap off-the-shelf FTDI USB-Serial cable.

It is tricker to find or replace the IF-10C. There is a commercial IF-10C [substitute][6] from Piexx that also include the level converter and a ribbon cable meant to bypass the 6-pin DIN (ACC1) and connect directly to a serial port.

If you want to roll your own there is a schematic and PCB layout [available][5]. This Japanese ham built his own [copy][12].

### Audio/PTT/Keyer Interface

Connected via 13-pin DIN ACC2.

The optocoupler for PTT is connected in a non-inverting way to the RTS line of a USB serial port. Some friendly applications like _fldigi_ lets you configure if you want the PTT to be a logical high or low. Some applications like _WSPR_ and _wsjtx_ don't and then the optocoupler might have to be connected so it inverts the RTS line.
