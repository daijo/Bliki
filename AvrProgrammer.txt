Avr Programmer
==============

Used to program a AVR without a bootloader (or to program the boatloader) via the boards ISP port.

ISP port
--------

10 and 6 pin connectors.

    MOSI 1 - 2 VCC
         3 - 4
    RST  5 - 6 GND
    SCK  7 - 8
    MISO 9 - 10

    MISO 1 - 2 VCC
    SCK  3 - 4 MOSI
    RST  5 - 6 GND

AVRDUDE

    $ avrdude -v

             Specify a programmer using the -c option and try again

Test the programmer:

    avrdude -c usbtiny -p m8
    
    avrdude: initialization failed, rc=-1
             Double check connections and try again, or use -F to override
             this check.
    
    
    avrdude done.  Thank you.

Wazup..

    $ avrdude -c usbtiny -p m8 -F
    
    avrdude: initialization failed, rc=-1
    avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions
    avrdude: Device signature = 0x000000
    avrdude: Yikes!  Invalid device signature.
    avrdude: Expected signature for ATMEGA8 is 1E 93 07
    
    avrdude done.  Thank you.

This means AVRDUDE is talking to the programmer but the programmer can't reach the chip. Check the connections to the board. Is the connector orientated correctly? Indeed the connection was at fault, we try again.

    $ avrdude -c usbtiny -p m8
    
    avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

             Double check chip, or use -F to override this check.

    avrdude done.  Thank you.

Now it looks better but still not A-ok. Seems like we identify the chip to be programmed incorrectly. The board I used was a Seeeduino V2.21 Atmega 328P which is a atmega328.

    $ avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p

    avrdude done.  Thank you.

Perfect! Lets program!
