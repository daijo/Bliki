~Debian Setup
=============

Virtualbox
----------
In VirtualBox -> Devices -> Install Guest Additions...

mount cd:
mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /cdrom

Guest additions:
cd /cdrom and run ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run

You might get an error about installing linux kernel headers and build packages. That can easily be solved by using apt-get :

apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`

Installing Window system drivers will fail if you haven't got one yet.

umount /cdrom
