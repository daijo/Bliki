Few small audio related projects and some notes on their components and their application.

18V Rechargeable Battery Pack
-----------------------------

Built to power my ~CMoy with 18V. ~NiMH constant current charging using LM317. Needs a 24V supply to charge.

### LM317 Linear Voltage Regulator

The LM317 is a variable voltage regulator. In this device it's setup as a constant current regulator. The regulator have three pins, in, out and adjust. The regulator holds 1.25 V between the out and adjust pin. This is used to get the constant current.


          _______    out
    in --| LM317 |--------\
          ---|---         |
             | adjust     -
             |           | |
             |           | | R
             |           | |
             |            -
             |            |
             +------------/
             |
             v i
             |


     Constant current i = 1.25 / R

There is a ~3V voltage drop over the regulator (we'll some heat here, P = 3V * i). That's why we need some extra voltage on the supply compared to the batteries to charge.

I set R to charge the battery in 10 hours (C/10) which is a fairly moderate rate that doesn't require anything more advanced. I usually let it charge over night after a day of use. Seems to work well.


~CMoy Headphone Amplifier
------------------------

Wanted an easy project to build an also had a need for a small headphone amp to use at work.

### OPA2132PA Operational Amplifier (~OpAmp)

An op-amp sets it's output voltage to the voltage difference between the inputs times a open-loop gain A. This gain is very large so even small difference between the inputs make the op-amp deliver the supply voltage to the output.
            
          Vs+ 
           |
           \
    V+ ---| \
          |  \____ out
    V- ---|  /
          | /
           /
           |
          Vs-

To reduce the gain a negative feedback loop. That is portion of the output voltage is then led back to the inverting input (V-).

This is how it's set up in the CMoy and the inout is put on the non inverting inout pin (V+) making this a non-inverting amplifier.

           Vs+ 
            |
            \
    V+  ---| \
           |  \____ out----+--
    V- +---|  /            |
       |   | /             |
       |    /              |
       |   | Vs-           |
       |             Rf    |
       +-----------|====|--/
       |
       -
      | |
      | | Rg
      | |
       -
       |
      GND


The gain of this amplifier is then G = 1 + Rf/Rg.

### Power supply

Decoupling capacitors, voltage devider.

Virtual ground, why, why not.

12AU7 + Mosfet Headphone Amplifier
----------------------------------

After the ~CMoy I wanted to build something with a few more parts and also have a look at vacuum tubes and discrete transistors. I found a simple design using a 12AU7 tube and mosfets at [DIY Audio Projects](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/).

### 12AU7 (ECC82)

This is a twin triode vaccum tube. Triode means it has a cathode, andode and a grid. Twin just mean that there are two in one, i.e. two channels, so only one tube is needed for stereo.

### Mosfet IRF510

LM317 as constant current source (see the battery pack).


Elekit PS-3238 powered by Airport Express

Bathroom stereo :)

How will it run on the 5V/100mA from the Airport Express?
