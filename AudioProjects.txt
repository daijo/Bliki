~CMoy Headphone Amplifier
------------------------

Wanted an easy project to build an also had a need for a small headphone amp to use at work.

### OPA2132PA Operational Amplifier (~OpAmp)

An op-amp sets it's output voltage to the voltage difference between the inputs times a open-loop gain A. This gain is very large so even small difference between the inputs make the op-amp deliver the supply voltage to the output.
            
          Vs+ 
           |
           \
    V+ ---| \
          |  \____ out
    V- ---|  /
          | /
           /
           |
          Vs-

To reduce the gain a negative feedback loop. That is portion of the output voltage is then led back to the inverting input (V-).

This is how it's set up in the CMoy and the inout is put on the non inverting inout pin (V+) making this a non-inverting amplifier.

           Vs+ 
            |
            \
    V+  ---| \
           |  \____ out----+--
    V- +---|  /            |
       |   | /             |
       |    /              |
       |   | Vs-           |
       |             Rf    |

       -
      | |
      | | Rg
      | |
       -
       |
      GND


The gain of this amplifier is then G = 1 + Rf/Rg.

### Power supply

To get the supply voltage rails there is a simple voltage divider with a pair of filtering capacitors. The virtual ground is tapped between the two resistors and capacitors.

There are more advanced designs using active components to make a virtual ground that is always exactly between the postive and negative rail. More info about this [here](http://tangentsoft.net/elec/vgrounds.html).

This simple one works well for me. If you want to use a single 9V battery to drive the amp and/or use low impedans headphones you should look further.

To power the amp with 18V I built a small rechargeable battery pack. It contains 2 ~NiMH 9V batteries and is constant current charging using LM317. Needs a 24V supply to charge.

### LM317 Linear Voltage Regulator

The LM317 is a variable voltage regulator. In this device it's setup as a constant current regulator. The regulator have three pins, in, out and adjust. The regulator holds 1.25 V between the out and adjust pin. This is used to get the constant current.


          _______    out
    in --| LM317 |--------\
          ---|---         |
             | adjust     -
             |           | |
             |           | | R
             |           | |
             |            -
             |            |
             +------------/
             |
             v i
             |


     Constant current i = 1.25 / R

There is a ~3V voltage drop over the regulator (we'll some heat here, P = 3V * i). That's why we need some extra voltage on the supply compared to the batteries to charge.

I set R to charge the battery in 10 hours (C/10) which is a fairly moderate rate that doesn't require anything more advanced. I usually let it charge over night after a day of use. Seems to work well.

Elekit PS-3239
--------------

A small amp kit using the TEA2025B chip. Looks pretty much like the design in the datasheet.

The screw terminals wasn't included in the kit but it felt like a good idea adding them. Lesson learned from my CMoy that is basically soldered into its Altoid box never to be moved. Nice with some extra flexibility.

![Completed board](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7246/7476398620_c69cedf9fd_z.jpg)

Put together as a small and cheap and battery operable stereo system. I got a pair of Fostex full range speakers to use for this purpose. These are good quality drivers so should be able to keep them if I build better amps in the future.

BOM:

* 1 x Elekit PS-3239 stereo amplifier kit (2 x 2.4W into 8 ohm) 1340 JPY
* 1 x 12V/2A wall wart 1200 JPY
* 2 x Fostex P800-E speaker cabinets 2800 JPY / pair
* 2 x Fostex FF85WK full fange drivers 5600 JPY / pair
* Some connectors and a volume knob ~<1000 JPY
* 1 Altoid tin bought in Cambodia $2 incl. mints

Total: ~12000 JPY (mainly for the speakers)

![Testing](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7476399276_9b0bcac757_z.jpg)

Worked well. Unless you're throwing a party or is in a big room it's powerful enough with these speakers. Audio quality it seem to sound best at about 1/3 of max volume with a 9V battery. Data below on the TEA2025B chip supports that.

![Mounted in Altoid tin](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7486536968_8a686e11bd_z.jpg)

With the screw terminals on the board the final assembly was a breeze.

### Power supply

The 12V wall wart I got didnt work well. I'm not sure about it's specs. I verified it's isolated but might be unregulated and maybe a switcher. Anyway it makes the amp hum. Will try and make some measurements on it later.

Result was a lot better with a single 9V battery.

### TEA2025B

From data sheet:

> The TEA2025B/D is a monolithic integrated circuit intended for use as dual or bridge power audio amplifier portable radio cassette players.

So not exactly a Hi-Fi amp perhaps.

The power output is a function of speaker impedans and input voltage. In 8 ohm 9V give a maximum of ~1.4W and 12V give 2.4W.

In 8 ohm the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) take a big jump above 0.4W in output power.

12AU7 + Mosfet Headphone Amplifier
----------------------------------

After the ~CMoy I wanted to build something with a few more parts and also have a look at vacuum tubes and discrete transistors. I found a simple design using a 12AU7 tube and mosfets at [DIY Audio Projects](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/).

![Bento amp](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/9094131910_90d464f814_z.jpg)

I built it point-to-point in a plastic bento box for extra frugality points.

### 12AU7 (ECC82)

This is a twin triode vaccum tube. Triode means it has a cathode (filament), andode (plate) and a grid. Twin just mean that there are two in one, i.e. two channels, so only one tube is needed for stereo.

The tube is set up as a inverting amplifier. The voltage supplied to the grid of the tube controls the current flowing through it. Since a resistor is connected between the plate and voltage source the potential at the plate varies with the current flowing through the tube. The resistor in this case is a trim potentiometer so you can adjust the plate voltage to be between the supply voltage and ground. Then the output can make the biggest swing peak to peak and we get a maximum of voltage gain without clipping.

![Clipping](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/9084571386_5c779426a7_o.jpg)

If the plate is biased to close to the voltage source we get clipping very fast like above.

![No Clipping](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/9082352847_ae5d88e5c3_o.jpg)

Correctly biased we can get more than 5x voltage gain.

### Mosfet IRF510

The plate of the tube is connected to the gate of a Mosfet configured as a source follower with LM317 as constant current source (see the battery pack). We loose a little voltage in this stgae (maybe 5%) but it can supply a lot more current than the tube.

In planning stage
-----------------

Below are some projects I'm currently planning to build in the future.

--------------------------------------------

For desk/workbench and initial testing of balanced DAC and speaker builds.

LM1875 based 25W mono blocks with balanced input
------------------------------------------------

For the livingroom. Using two K50 PCB kits.

Similar build:
