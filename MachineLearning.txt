================

Supervised
----------

Attaching predefined labels to data.

* Naive Bayes
* Linear regression
* k Nearest Neighbours

Unsupervised
------------

Clustering, finding classes of data.

* k-means clustering
* Expectation-maximization algorithm (probabilistic generalization of k-means)
* Linear dimensionality reduction
* Spectral clustering
