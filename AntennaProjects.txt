### 70cm Ground Plane

As seen in ARRL Antenna Book etc. Using a N connector instead of the traditional SO-239 connector. Very easy build, did most of it sitting on the sofa watching TV.

The crimped ring terminals make it easy to remove the groud radials for transport. They bend to so can be used to adjust the antennas impedans. At 90 degree angle the antennas impedans should be around 30 Ohm and raise to about 50 Ohm if the radials are at 45 degree angle.

Got very good reception of APRS packets at 431.04 MHz inside the apartment.

HF

A few shortwave antennas I tried with very little success. After a while I discovered where I live have severe interference pretty much across the whole HF spectrum and very little I can do about it. Shortwave on a hold until move somewhere else.
