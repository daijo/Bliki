Antenna Projects
================

A few antennas of other people's design I have modelled or built.

VHF/UHF
-------

### Wire hanger Quarter Wave Ground Plane

As seen in ARRL Antenna Book etc. Using a N connector instead of the traditional SO-239 connector. Very easy build, did most of it sitting on the sofa watching TV. Elements are cut from wire-hangers which are 2mm in diameter.

The crimped ring terminals make it easy to remove the groud radials for transport. They bend to so can be used to adjust the antennas impedans, although I wouldn't try that more than a couple of times. At 90 degree angle the antennas impedans should be around 30 Ohm and raise to about 50 Ohm if the radials are at 45 degree angle.

Got very good reception of APRS packets at 431.04 ~MHz inside the apartment. Will probably need scavenge more wire hangers to build a 2m version.

### 2 Element Wire Hanger Yagi

After building the quarter wave it seemed doable to build a small light Yagi for the 70cm band from wire-hangers too. Although it models pretty good I wouldn't use it for transmitting before tuning it carefully cause millimeters matter.

The elements were cut and for boom I used a length of MDF board I had left over. Not the best material probably but worked well for a prototype. Two grooves where cut and the reflector glued into the back one. The driven element soldered to a BNC connector and glued into the front groove.

A light Yagi like this could come in handy for receiving a 70cm satellite downlink like that of S0-50.

### 70cm/2m Yagi

A 2m Yagi with open sleeve arrangement for 70cm. Described by [WB5CXC](http://www.wb5cxc.com/dualv_ant.html) and [DK7ZB](http://dk7zb.darc.de/Duoband/duoband_2-70_2-3.htm).

4 element model:

![4 Element Dual Band Yagi-Uda](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daijo/~AntennaModels/blob/master/4ElementDualBandYagi.png?raw=true)

Started with WB5CXC's design but had to tune it a little to bring the VSWR down on both bands.

5 element model:

Also after WB5CXC's design but was harder to get the VSWR inline for this. Maybe easier if can automaticaly optimise in CocoaNEC (which should be possible).

Will probably try to build a 4 element version. This could be a good antenna for satellite communication.

HF
--

A few shortwave antennas I tried with very little success. After a while I discovered where I live have severe interference pretty much across the whole HF spectrum and very little I can do about it. Shortwave on a hold until move somewhere else.

### SWL Random Wire
