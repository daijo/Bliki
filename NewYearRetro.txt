Just writting a post while it's still 2015. A lot have happened since the last post. We moved from Japan to Sweden. Bought a house. Bought a boat. I got a ham license (SA7DAI). So if I would make a new years resolution related to this space it would be that next year there will be more posts. I have lot I could write about.

Happy new 2016!
