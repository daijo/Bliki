Standup Meeting
===============

> A stand-up meeting (or simply stand-up) is a daily team meeting held to provide a status update to the team members. The 'semi-real-time' status allows participants to know about potential challenges as well as coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues. It has particular value in Agile software development processes,[1][2] such as Scrum, but can be utilized in any development methodology. - [Wikipedia][1]
