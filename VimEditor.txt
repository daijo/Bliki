Call a movement command in a script:

    exe "normal! gg"

Toggle mode using Caps-Lock
---------------------------

* Use the program [~PCKeyboardHack](http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/extra.html) to map Caps-Lock to F12 (disable any shortcuts and set function keys to work as functions keys).
* Add lines below to .vimrc to use F12 to toggle between Command mode and Insert mode.


        nnoremap <F12> i
        imap <F12> <Esc>
