~ContinuousImprovement
======================

A ongoing process of improving the work itself and it's outcome.


Agile Retrospectives
====================

A meeting with the people involved (project team) in the project looking back at a previous period of time. 

What did happen and when? What was good and what was bad? What can be improved? What is most important? Choose a limited improvment scope for the coming period of time and repeat the process.
