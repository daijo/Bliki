~PlainTextGtd
=============

[blog](http://leafraker.com/2007/10/24/gtd-with-plain-text-files/)

Edit .vimrc to fold on # markdown headers.

Example:

    # Today

    # Calendar

    # Follow up

    # Sometime/Maybe
    ## Work

    ## Private

Also see PersonalKanban, it's a complement and  works well in plain text too.
