Speaker Projects
================

Fostex FF85WK + P800-E
----------------------

Fostex full range drivers in small enclosure built by Fostex. Not much DIY but got my feets wet.

I have used these speakers with both my mini amp and 2*15W T-class with great result. Nice desktop speaker for a low price.

Fostex FE-103En + Nagaoka BS-10
-------------------------------

Something slightly bigger and a cabinet built from "scratch". I didn't have the actual plans for the BS-10 but used some build photos, the thickness of the MDF and outer dimensions to estimate the measurements I was missing.

I picked up the speakers and damping material in a speaker speciality shop in Akihabara. The connectors I got from Taobao.

I listed the different sizes of MDF I needed and went to Tokyo Hands. The clerk helped to figure out what I needed to buy and how to cut it. I was ready for pickup a few days later. The pieces was cut with perfect precision.
