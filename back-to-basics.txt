I'm a fan of Plain Text Wikis like Mark Reid's Text mate plugin and the PotWiki plugin for Vim. I've been keeping one on my laptop for my personal reference for about a year using both plugins on the same files. It's great to have something that simple working that great. Last month my laptop got stolen and it pushed me to push the Wiki to a private GitHub repo. So now my Wiki is Gitified and I'm a little happier then before.

Next question: Can I put my blog in Git? I have a hosted WordPress blog that began with the an exported BlogSpot blog. So how about a Plain Text Blog stored in a git that I can push to my webserver? Sounds neat. Of course you're never first with an idea.

But this seem a bit too heavyweight for me. Ruby? Gems? Heroku? Too much. I'm thinking the dependencies should be limited to Git and basic UnixTools. It will be a static page. Comments? If you care enough you can Tweet (@dhjo) or IRC (daijo in #techareg on EfNet) me for now. Good comments will be published :P

But I will however steal the Toto format of having a YAML header for blog posts. This post have the header:

I'll save it as back-to-basics.txt and it will be the first commit to my blog git. Lets see when you can read it on the Web.

I'm saving the best to last. I will keep the notion on Plain Text Wikis and this will really be a Plain Text BLIKI! CamelCase words will link to files like CamelCase.txt if I use a editor plugin (or CamelCase.html after being pushed to a server and converted).
